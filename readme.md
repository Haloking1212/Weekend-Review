## Objectives for today

- Emulate my build week website at: https://gigapet-jb.netlify.com/
- Using LESS create the styles to match
- Use Variables to match the colorscheme
- Create a mixin for the text styles
- Create a parametric mixin for the buttons and make each unique
- Make it mobile responsive

## Use the following colors

- background: white
- nav-bar-container: #9eb1cd
- background for your text: rgba(44, 157, 166, 0.4)
- button bg: #c63170
- custom font: 'Dokdo', cursive

## Practice your git flow

- Fork this
- Add your TL as a collaborator
- Clone to your local machine
- Create your own branch (<firstname-lastname>)
- Start coding!
- Commit every major change, (header, buttons, etc)
- Push when you're done
- Create pull request
- Add TL as reviewer (since they haven't accepted use @[theirgithubhandle] in the comments)
- Compare your named branch to your master branch (_NOT MINE_)
- Submit request
